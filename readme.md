Hi! My name is Paul.

I've been helping college students learn how to program for 10 years.

As a data obsessed person, my favorite language is Python for its ease of use. I love how quickly it enables me to dive into projects in different domains: data science, mathematical simulations, finance, natural language processing, and graph theory.

Lately, I've been learning concurrent programming in Go and trying out Postgres.
